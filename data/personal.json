        "I've always been driven by the challenge of building from the ground up. My career began in the high-energy environments of hackathons and early-stage startups, where I worked alongside founders to shape products from scratch. These experiences instilled in me a product-first mindset: the ability to move fast, take ownership, and build features that solve genuine user needs.",
        "Currently, at Arista Networks, I've shifted my focus toward the foundations of computing, working on software that operates close to the hardware. In an environment where performance and correctness are non-negotiable, I develop components within complex frameworks, prioritizing test-driven development and long-term maintainability. This role has sharpened my technical precision and my appreciation for clean, scalable system architecture.",
        "Whether I'm navigating the ambiguity of a new venture or the rigorous engineering standards of a global leader, my goal remains the same: to understand exactly how things work so I can build systems that work better. I thrive on diving into technical challenges that demand both creative problem-solving and a disciplined approach to craftsmanship."
